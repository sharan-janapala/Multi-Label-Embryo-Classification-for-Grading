# Multi-Label-Embryo-Classification-for-Grading
Multi-Label Embryo Classification for Grading is an AI-driven project that focuses on automated embryo morphology assessment and clinically interpretable grading using blastocyst-stage embryo images. The objective of this work is to reduce subjectivity and inter-observer variability in manual embryo grading by providing a consistent, component-level analysis that supports IVF decision-making. Instead of predicting a single embryo grade directly, the system independently predicts key morphological components and derives a final grade using a transparent scoring logic.

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Figshare and consists of clinically annotated human embryo images. Only image files and four columns from the clinical annotations file were used: image name, EXP_silver, ICM_silver, and TE_silver. The dataset was carefully cleaned and aligned to ensure a one-to-one correspondence between images and labels, with unaligned images identified and excluded to prevent data leakage. Exploratory data analysis revealed class imbalance and adjacent-grade overlap, which are common in clinical embryo grading and influenced downstream modeling choices.

Image preprocessing included resizing and normalization, followed by medically safe data augmentation applied only to the training set, such as horizontal and vertical flips, controlled rotations, and mild brightness, saturation, and exposure adjustments. Model training was performed using a multi-output EfficientNet-B0 architecture for simultaneous prediction of EXP, ICM, and TE scores, along with an additional ResNet50 model using Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to better capture grading ambiguity between neighboring classes. Models were evaluated using overall and component-wise accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and confidence scores.

Predicted component scores were normalized and combined into a Morphology Index using clinically inspired weights, which was then mapped to final embryo grades (A–D) for interpretability. The trained system was deployed as a Streamlit web application, enabling real-time inference, confidence visualization, annotated image outputs, and downloadable CSV reports. This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline—from clinically annotated data to deployment—designed as a clinical decision-support tool rather than a replacement for expert embryologist judgment.
